This was the first game I have ever worked with and I was really fun! I really like this assignment because I got to experience the concept on how a game works epecially movement. I had lots of fun creating a boss like character for my space invaders and decided to take an alien like image that is double the size of the regular aliens then when it is involved in a collision the size decreases by half until it is below 16 x 16 pixels. I started working on the old school arcade highscores but was unable to fully implement it. I have the highscore showing but I just need to find out how to take user input from the keyboard in pygame to implement the three letter highscore. The only struggle that I saw was getting used to a new library like pygame but I feel like that is how it will always be when learning a new library or computer language. I would just tell future students to not be discouraged when going through these assignments and to break down what they want to do so they do not overwhelm themselves. I felt like this assignment was pretty straight forward and liked that you gave us the option of what we wanted to improve.
